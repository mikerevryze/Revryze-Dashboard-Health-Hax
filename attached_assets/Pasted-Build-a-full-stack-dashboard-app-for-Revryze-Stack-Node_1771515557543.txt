Build a full-stack dashboard app for Revryze.

Stack:
- Node.js + Express backend
- React frontend (Vite)
- Snowflake connection using snowflake-sdk
- Clean, modern dark UI
- Fully responsive
- No unnecessary libraries

Branding:
- Background: #000000
- Primary green: #10E29C
- Light gray: #E5E5E5
- Font: clean, modern, bold headings
- Include Revryze logo in top left
- Minimal, high-contrast, data-focused layout

Environment Variables Required:
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT
SNOWFLAKE_USER
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA

---------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------

Create backend endpoint:

GET /api/metrics

Query Snowflake and return:

1. closed_won_count
2. closed_won_value
3. total_spend
4. total_leads

Assume tables:

deals
- stage
- deal_value

ads
- spend
- leads

SQL logic:

SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deals WHERE stage = 'Closed Won') AS closed_won_count,
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(deal_value),0) FROM deals WHERE stage = 'Closed Won') AS closed_won_value,
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(spend),0) FROM ads) AS total_spend,
  (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(leads),0) FROM ads) AS total_leads;

---------------------------------
FRONTEND DASHBOARD
---------------------------------

Display metric cards:

1. Closed Won Deals
2. Closed Won Revenue
3. Total Ad Spend
4. CPL (calculate frontend: total_spend / total_leads)
5. Cost Per Membership (total_spend / closed_won_count)
6. Lead-to-Sale Conversion Rate (closed_won_count / total_leads)

All numbers formatted cleanly:
- Currency with $
- Percentages with 2 decimals

---------------------------------
GOAL CALCULATOR SECTION
---------------------------------

User can input:

Goal Membership Count

Calculate dynamically:

conversionRate = closed_won_count / total_leads
cpl = total_spend / total_leads

requiredLeads = goalMemberships / conversionRate
requiredSpend = requiredLeads * cpl

Display:

- Required Leads
- Required Spend

Update instantly as user types.

---------------------------------
UI REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------

Layout:
- Top: Revryze logo
- Below: 6 metric cards in responsive grid
- Below: Goal Calculator in highlighted green bordered section

Style:
- Rounded cards
- Subtle shadows
- Hover animation
- Large bold numbers
- Clean spacing
- Dark executive feel
